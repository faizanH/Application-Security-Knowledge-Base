# Application Security Knowledge Base

Welcome to the **Application Security Knowledge Base**! This repository is a comprehensive collection of notes, insights, and structured information covering various facets of application security. Whether you're a developer looking to write more secure code, a security professional aiming to deepen your understanding, or simply curious about how applications can be attacked and defended, you'll find valuable resources here.


## What's Inside?

This knowledge base is organized into four main directories, each focusing on a key area of application security:

### Attack Scenarios
Dive into real-world and hypothetical attack methodologies. This section breaks down how malicious actors exploit weaknesses in applications, helping you understand the "how" behind security incidents.

### Secure Design Patterns
Learn about architectural and design principles that bake security into applications from the ground up. This directory provides guidance on building robust and resilient systems that are inherently more resistant to attack.

### Security Fundamentals
This section covers the core concepts and foundational knowledge necessary for understanding application security. It's a great starting point for beginners and a solid refresher for experienced professionals.

### Vulnerabilities & Secure Coding
Explore detailed information on common application vulnerabilities, from OWASP Top 10 to lesser-known flaws. Alongside each vulnerability, you'll find practical advice and examples on how to write secure code to prevent or mitigate these weaknesses.


## How This Knowledge Base Was Built

The content within this repository is a blend of my personal notes and extensive contributions from **Gemini**. I've utilized structured templates to guide Gemini's output, ensuring a high degree of consistency, accuracy, and depth across all topics. This collaborative approach combines human expertise with advanced AI capabilities to create a truly comprehensive resource.


## Contribution & Feedback

This knowledge base is designed to be a living resource and will be continuously get updated with more information and topics. While direct contributions via pull requests aren't currently enabled, I welcome any feedback, suggestions for improvement, or new topics you'd like to see covered.
