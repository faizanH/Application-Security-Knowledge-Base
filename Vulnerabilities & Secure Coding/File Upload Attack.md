## 🧠 Description

**What it is:**

- **Simple terms:** Imagine a website allows you to upload a profile picture. A file upload attack happens when an attacker tricks the website into uploading a _malicious file_ (like a hidden program or a script that runs on the server) instead of a harmless image. Once uploaded, the attacker can then often run their malicious code on the server, taking control of the website or the server itself.
    
- **Technical explanation:** A file upload vulnerability occurs when a web application allows users to upload files to the server without sufficient validation or sanitization of the file's type, content, or name. Attackers exploit this by uploading a malicious file (e.g., a web shell, a script with server-side code like PHP, ASP, JSP, or even an executable) that can be later accessed and executed by the attacker. This often leads to Remote Code Execution (RCE), giving the attacker full control over the compromised server.
    

**Where it occurs:**

- **Backend:** Primarily occurs on the backend where the file processing, storage, and execution take place. The vulnerability lies in the server-side validation logic (or lack thereof).
    
- **Frontend (indirectly):** Frontend controls (like JavaScript checks for file extensions) can be easily bypassed by an attacker using proxy tools, so they are not a reliable defense.
    
- **API:** File upload endpoints in REST or GraphQL APIs are equally susceptible if backend validation is missing.
    

**Root cause:**

- **Untrusted Input:** The fundamental root cause is the failure to properly validate and sanitize **all aspects** of the uploaded file:
    
    - **File Name/Extension:** Trusting the client-provided file extension (`.php`, `.asp`, `.jsp`, `.exe`, `.sh`).
        
    - **File Content/MIME Type:** Trusting the client-provided `Content-Type` header (MIME type) without verifying the actual file content (e.g., checking if an "image" is truly an image).
        
    - **File Size:** Not enforcing reasonable limits, leading to potential Denial of Service (DoS).
        
    - **File Path/Location:** Storing files in publicly accessible or executable directories.
        
- **Insecure Configuration:** Web server configurations that allow execution of scripts in upload directories, or lack of proper permissions on upload folders.
    

**The different types:** File upload vulnerabilities are less about "types" and more about the **methods used to bypass security controls**:

1. **Extension Bypass:**
    
    - **Blacklisting Bypass:** Attacker uploads a file with an allowed extension but tricks the server into executing it (e.g., `shell.php.jpg`, `shell.php%00.jpg`, `shell.php;.jpg`, `shell.php/`).
        
    - **Whitelisting Bypass:** Attacker finds an allowed but misconfigured extension that can still be executed (e.g., `.phtml`, `.shtml`, `.asa`, `.aspx`, `.cer`, `.pl`).
        
    - **Double Extension:** `file.jpg.php` (if the server processes the last extension or truncates the name).
        
2. **MIME Type Bypass:**
    
    - Attacker modifies the `Content-Type` header in the HTTP request to match an allowed type (e.g., `image/jpeg`) even if the file content is a web shell.
        
3. **Content Bypass:**
    
    - Attacker embeds malicious code within a seemingly valid file type (e.g., hiding PHP code within EXIF metadata of a JPEG image, or within an SVG file's XML).
        
4. **Path Traversal/Null Byte Injection:**
    
    - Attacker attempts to save the file to an arbitrary or executable directory using path traversal sequences (`../`) or null bytes (`%00`) to truncate the file name and bypass extension checks.
        
5. **Race Conditions:**
    
    - Attacker uploads a malicious file, then immediately tries to execute it before the server's validation or renaming process completes.
        

## 🧪 Exploitation Techniques

**Step-by-step walkthrough of how it’s exploited:**

1. **Identify Upload Functionality:** Find any feature allowing file uploads (profile pictures, document attachments, media galleries).
    
2. **Analyze Existing Protections:**
    
    - **Client-side:** Check browser dev tools for JavaScript validation on file types/extensions. (This is easily bypassed).
        
    - **Server-side:** Attempt to upload various file types (e.g., `.php`, `.txt`, `.jpg`, `.exe`). Observe error messages and server responses to understand validation rules.
        
3. **Craft Malicious Payload (Web Shell):** Create a simple web shell (e.g., a PHP file that executes OS commands).
    
    - Example: `<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>`
        
4. **Bypass File Type/Extension Validation:**
    
    - **Method 1 (MIME Type):** Intercept the upload request with a proxy (e.g., Burp Suite). Change the `Content-Type` header to an allowed type (e.g., `image/jpeg`), but keep the malicious extension (e.g., `shell.php`).
        
    - **Method 2 (Extension Bypass):** Rename the file to an allowed extension, but with a trick (e.g., `shell.php.jpg`, `shell.jpg.php`, `shell.php%00.jpg`). Experiment with various combinations.
        
    - **Method 3 (Content Bypass):** Embed the web shell code within a legitimate file format (e.g., EXIF data of a JPEG) and upload it as a valid image.
        
5. **Upload the Malicious File:** Send the modified request through the proxy.
    
6. **Locate the Uploaded File:** Determine the URL or path where the file was stored (often based on server response, predictable naming conventions, or directory brute-forcing).
    
7. **Execute the Web Shell:** Access the uploaded malicious file via a web browser. Pass commands as URL parameters if using a simple shell (e.g., `http://example.com/uploads/shell.php?cmd=ls -la`). This provides Remote Code Execution (RCE).
    

**Payload examples:**

- **Simple PHP Web Shell:**
    
    ```sh
    <?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>
    ```
    
    - _Usage:_ `http://vulnerable.com/uploads/shell.php?cmd=id` (to get user ID)
        
- **ASP.NET Web Shell:**
    
    ```sh
    <%@ Page Language="C#"%>
    <%
    System.Diagnostics.Process p = new System.Diagnostics.Process();
    p.StartInfo.FileName = "cmd.exe";
    p.StartInfo.Arguments = "/c " + Request["cmd"];
    p.StartInfo.UseShellExecute = false;
    p.StartInfo.RedirectStandardOutput = true;
    p.Start();
    String output = p.StandardOutput.ReadToEnd();
    Response.Write("<pre>" + output + "</pre>");
    %>
    ```
    
    - _Usage:_ `http://vulnerable.com/uploads/shell.aspx?cmd=dir`
        
- **Polyglot Image (JPEG with PHP payload):**
    
    ```sh
    (Binary JPEG data here)
    <?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>
    ```
    
    - Tools like `exiftool` can be used to inject this into legitimate JPEGs.
        

**Tools used:**

- **Burp Suite (or ZAP):** Absolutely essential for intercepting and modifying HTTP requests (especially `Content-Type` headers and file names).
    
- **`curl`:** For testing direct access to uploaded files and executing commands.
    
- **Text Editor:** To create the web shell files.
    
- **File Renaming Utilities:** For experimenting with double extensions, null bytes, etc.
    
- **`exiftool`:** For injecting payloads into image metadata.
    
- **`ffuf` / `dirb` / `gobuster`:** For directory brute-forcing to locate upload directories or the uploaded malicious file.
    

**Real-world examples (CVE, bugs in libraries or apps):**

- Many content management systems (CMS) and forum software have historically suffered from file upload vulnerabilities, especially older versions or custom plugins that didn't implement proper validation.
    
- **CVE-2017-12611 (Apache Struts 2):** While complex, some Struts vulnerabilities allowed for arbitrary file upload due to deserialization flaws, leading to RCE.
    
- **WordPress Plugins:** Numerous WordPress plugins have been found vulnerable to unauthenticated or authenticated arbitrary file upload, leading to site compromise. Examples include themes and plugins for contact forms, gallery uploads, or file managers.
    
- **Cloud environments:** Misconfigured S3 buckets or similar storage services that allow public `PutObject` operations can also be exploited for file uploads.
    

## 🔎 Code Review Tips

**What patterns or red flags to look for:**

- **Trusting Client-Side Validation:** Any reliance on JavaScript checks for file types/extensions without corresponding robust server-side validation.
    
- **Direct Use of Client-Provided Filename/Extension:** Code directly using `request.file.filename` or similar to determine the file type or storage path.
    
- **Blacklisting Extensions:** Using a blacklist approach (e.g., "deny `.php`, `.asp`, `.exe`") instead of a whitelist. Blacklists are inherently insecure as they are often incomplete.
    
- **Storing Uploads in Web-Accessible Directories:** Files stored in `www/uploads/` or `public/images/` without ensuring they cannot be executed.
    
- **Lack of MIME Type Validation (or only trusting `Content-Type` header):** Not actually inspecting the file's _magic bytes_ or performing a proper content analysis to determine its true type.
    
- **Missing Size Limits:** No constraints on the maximum size of uploaded files.
    
- **Arbitrary File Overwrites:** If existing files can be overwritten by uploaded files.
    

**Bad vs good code examples (especially Python and TS):**

- **Bad Python (Flask - Insecure File Upload):**

**What functions/APIs are often involved:**

- **File System Operations:** `fs.writeFile`, `fs.rename`, `os.path.join`, `os.makedirs`, `fs.unlinkSync` (Node.js); `open()`, `os.path.join`, `os.remove` (Python).
    
- **HTTP Request Handling:** Libraries/frameworks for parsing multipart form data (`multer` in Node.js, `Flask.request.files` in Python).
    
- **MIME Type Detection:** Libraries for magic byte analysis (e.g., `file-type` in Node.js, `imghdr`/`python-magic` in Python).
    
- **Filename Sanitization:** Functions like `werkzeug.utils.secure_filename` (Python), or custom logic for sanitizing filenames and preventing path traversal.
    

**Where in the app codebase you'd usually find this:**

- **Upload Endpoints/Routes:** The API endpoints (`/upload`, `/profile_picture`, `/attach_document`) that receive file data.
    
- **File Processing Modules:** Dedicated services or functions responsible for handling file storage, resizing, or virus scanning.
    
- **Configuration Files:** Settings related to upload directories, allowed file types, and maximum file sizes.
    
- **Web Server Configuration (e.g., Nginx, Apache):** Rules that define how files in certain directories are served or whether they can be executed.
    

## 🛡️ Mitigation Strategies

**Input validation/sanitization (Most Critical for File Uploads):** This is the primary defense against file upload attacks and requires multiple layers:

1. **Whitelist File Extensions:** Instead of blacklisting, maintain a strict whitelist of _allowed_ extensions (e.g., `jpg`, `png`, `pdf`).
    
2. **Validate Actual File Content (Magic Bytes):** Do not trust the `Content-Type` header from the client. Read the file's "magic bytes" (the first few bytes) to determine its true file type. Use libraries designed for this (e.g., `imghdr` or `python-magic` in Python, `file-type` in Node.js).
    
3. **Sanitize Filenames:**
    
    - **Prevent Path Traversal:** Strip `../`, `..\`, null bytes (`%00`), and other special characters. Use functions like `werkzeug.utils.secure_filename`.
        
    - **Generate Unique Names:** Rename uploaded files to unique, random names (e.g., UUIDs) to prevent overwrites, make guessing harder, and ensure the original malicious filename isn't used for execution.
        
4. **Enforce File Size Limits:** Set maximum and minimum file size limits to prevent DoS attacks and resource exhaustion.
    

**Encoding/escaping best practices:**

- Not directly applicable to preventing the _upload_ of malicious files, but crucial for preventing XSS in other parts of the application where file metadata or names might be displayed back to the user.
    

**Framework-specific protections:**

- Modern web frameworks (Flask, Django, Express with `multer`) provide utilities to help with file handling, but **they do not automatically provide full security against file upload attacks**. Developers must explicitly implement the validation steps outlined above.
    
- Some frameworks/libraries might have built-in filename sanitization (like Flask's `secure_filename`), but validating file _content_ is almost always a manual step.
    

**Secure configurations (headers, CSPs, etc.):**

1. **Store Uploads Outside Web Root:** Ideally, store uploaded files in a directory that is _not_ directly accessible by the web server (e.g., `/var/lib/mywebapp/uploads` instead of `/var/www/html/uploads`). Serve them via a separate, controlled endpoint or a CDN.
    
2. **Non-Executable Upload Directories:** If files must be stored within the web root, configure your web server (Apache, Nginx, IIS) to **explicitly prevent script execution** (PHP, ASP, JSP, etc.) in the upload directories. This is a critical second layer of defense.
    
3. **Strict File Permissions:** Set restrictive file system permissions on upload directories and uploaded files (e.g., `chmod 644` for files, `755` for directories), preventing web processes from modifying or executing files they shouldn't.
    
4. **Content Security Policy (CSP):** While primarily for XSS, a strong CSP can limit where scripts can be loaded from, potentially mitigating some advanced file upload attack vectors if an attacker tries to load external scripts from their uploaded file.
    
5. **Virus/Malware Scanning:** Integrate server-side antivirus/malware scanning of all uploaded files. This should happen _after_ the file is uploaded to a temporary, isolated storage, and _before_ it's moved to its final location.
    

**Defense-in-depth:**

- **Multiple Validation Layers:** Implement validation at the client-side (for UX), server-side (for security), and optionally at the file storage service (e.g., S3 bucket policies restricting object types).
    
- **Image Optimization/Resizing:** If you're uploading images, process them (e.g., resize, re-encode) upon upload. This can strip out malicious metadata or code embedded in the original file, effectively sanitizing it.
    
- **Dedicated Upload Service/CDN:** Use a dedicated service (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage) with strict access policies for file uploads. These services often have built-in security features.
    
- **User Upload Throttling:** Limit the rate at which users can upload files to prevent DoS.
    
- **Logging and Monitoring:** Log all file uploads, including the source IP, user ID, filename, and detected MIME type. Monitor for suspicious upload activity (e.g., executable file types, unusually large files, failed validation attempts).
    

## 🔐 Blockchain Context (if applicable)

File upload vulnerabilities, as they manifest in traditional web applications (uploading malicious code to a server), are **not directly applicable** to smart contracts or crypto wallet code.

- **Smart Contracts:** Smart contracts run on a blockchain's virtual machine (e.g., EVM for Ethereum). You "upload" bytecode to the blockchain, but this is a specific, immutable binary code that follows strict rules. You cannot "upload" arbitrary executable files (like PHP shells) that then run on the blockchain nodes. The execution environment is entirely different and isolated.
    
- **Crypto Wallets:** Wallets manage private keys and sign transactions. They interact with dApps via browser extensions or mobile apps. While the _dApp itself_ could potentially have a traditional file upload vulnerability (if it's a regular web application), the wallet software itself doesn't process "file uploads" in the sense of storing arbitrary server-side executables.
    

**Web3-specific risks (tangential concepts):**

While not a direct file upload attack, there are some related concepts or attack vectors that involve external data or code being brought into a Web3 context:

1. **Malicious DApp Frontend Hosting:** If a dApp's frontend (which is a traditional web application) allows insecure file uploads, an attacker could compromise the dApp's hosting server. This could then lead to:
    
    - **Supply Chain Attack:** Injecting malicious JavaScript into the dApp's frontend, potentially leading to phishing users' wallet credentials or tricking them into signing malicious transactions. This is a traditional web vulnerability, but its _impact_ affects Web3 users.
        
    - **Defacing:** Changing the dApp's content to mislead users.
        
2. **IPFS/Arweave Content Addressing:** When dApps store data or even their frontends on decentralized storage like IPFS or Arweave, they rely on content addressing. While this provides integrity (you can verify the content by its hash), it doesn't prevent someone from _uploading_ malicious content and then _luring_ users to that specific malicious hash. The "upload" isn't a vulnerability in the storage system, but the _distribution_ and _trust_ in the content's origin can be.
    
3. **Off-chain Data Feeds (Oracles):** If an oracle system (which brings off-chain data onto the blockchain) allows a compromised source to "upload" manipulated data, it could lead to incorrect smart contract execution. This isn't a "file upload" vulnerability, but a data integrity issue related to external inputs.
    

In summary, the file upload vulnerability is fundamentally a server-side web application issue related to arbitrary code execution on a traditional operating system. The decentralized and sandboxed nature of blockchain and smart contract execution environments largely prevents this specific attack vector from directly applying. However, the traditional web components (frontends, APIs, off-chain systems) that interact with Web3 can still be vulnerable to such attacks.
