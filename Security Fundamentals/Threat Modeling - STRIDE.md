# Understanding STRIDE in Threat Modeling

Threat modeling is a proactive approach to identifying potential security threats and vulnerabilities in a system or application _before_ it's built or deployed. It helps you think like an attacker and find design flaws early, when they are cheapest to fix.

One of the most popular and effective frameworks for conducting threat modeling is **STRIDE**. It's a mnemonic that helps you systematically categorize and identify common types of threats.

## What is STRIDE?

STRIDE is an acronym for six distinct categories of threats:

1. **S - Spoofing (of Identity)**
    
    - **What it means:** An attacker pretends to be someone or something else. This could be a user, a system, a process, or a resource.
        
    - **Security Property Violated:** Authenticity.
        
    - **Examples:**
        
        - An attacker steals a user's session cookie to impersonate them.
            
        - A malicious server pretends to be a legitimate API endpoint.
            
        - Phishing attacks (tricking a user into revealing credentials).
            
        - DNS spoofing.
            
2. **T - Tampering (of Data)**
    
    - **What it means:** An attacker modifies data that they are not authorized to change. This can happen to data in transit (e.g., during communication) or data at rest (e.g., in a database or file).
        
    - **Security Property Violated:** Integrity.
        
    - **Examples:**
        
        - SQL Injection to modify database records.
            
        - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) to force a user to make an unwanted action (modifying data).
            
        - Parameter tampering in a URL to change a price in an e-commerce transaction.
            
        - Modifying log files to cover tracks.
            
3. **R - Repudiation**
    
    - **What it means:** An attacker (or even a legitimate user) performs an action and then later denies having performed it, and the system cannot prove otherwise. This happens when there's insufficient logging or audit trails.
        
    - **Security Property Violated:** Non-repudiation.
        
    - **Examples:**
        
        - A user makes a transaction and then claims they didn't, and there's no cryptographic signature or sufficient log to prove it.
            
        - An administrator performs a sensitive action but the audit logs are incomplete or can be tampered with.
            
4. **I - Information Disclosure**
    
    - **What it means:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to sensitive information. This could be confidential data, personal identifiable information (PII), intellectual property, or system details.
        
    - **Security Property Violated:** Confidentiality.
        
    - **Examples:**
        
        - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) to steal user cookies or data.
            
        - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) to access internal network resources or cloud metadata.
            
        - Verbose error messages revealing stack traces or database schemas.
            
        - Directory listing enabled on a web server.
            
        - Publicly exposed cloud storage buckets.
            
5. **D - Denial of Service (DoS)**
    
    - **What it means:** An attacker prevents legitimate users from accessing a service or resource. This can involve crashing a system, exhausting resources, or overwhelming network capacity.
        
    - **Security Property Violated:** Availability.
        
    - **Examples:**
        
        - DDoS attacks overwhelming a web server.
            
        - Exploiting a bug that causes an application to crash repeatedly.
            
        - Resource exhaustion (e.g., filling up disk space, consuming all CPU cycles).
            
        - Infinite loops in code triggered by malicious input.
            
6. **E - Elevation of Privilege**
    
    - **What it means:** An attacker gains unauthorized higher-level access, permissions, or capabilities than they were originally granted.
        
    - **Security Property Violated:** Authorization (and sometimes Authenticity).
        
    - **Examples:**
        
        - A regular user gaining administrator rights.
            
        - Exploiting a buffer overflow to execute arbitrary code with root privileges.
            
        - Bypassing access controls to perform actions reserved for privileged accounts.
            
        - Compromising a low-privilege account and then finding a vulnerability to escalate to a system account.
            

## How to Apply STRIDE in Threat Modeling (The Process)

Applying STRIDE is typically done as part of a broader threat modeling process:

1. **Define the System and Scope:**
    
    - Clearly understand what you're threat modeling (e.g., a new user registration module, an entire microservice, a specific API endpoint).
        
    - What are its boundaries? What external systems does it interact with?
        
    - **Tool:** Often, this involves drawing **Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs)**. DFDs help visualize how data moves through your system, identifying processes, data stores, external entities, and data flows. They also help define **trust boundaries** (lines where the level of trust changes, like between a user's browser and your web server).
        
2. **Decompose the System:**
    
    - Break down the system into its core components (e.g., individual microservices, database, message queue, user interface, API gateway).
        
    - For each component, identify:
        
        - **Processes (P):** Any component that transforms or processes data (e.g., web server, application logic, API handler).
            
        - **Data Stores (D):** Where data resides (e.g., database, file system, cache).
            
        - **Data Flows (F):** How data moves between components (e.g., HTTP requests, messages on a queue).
            
        - **External Entities (E):** Users, third-party APIs, other systems that interact with your system.
            
3. **Identify Threats (Apply STRIDE):**
    
    - This is the core of STRIDE. For _each_ identified component (P, D, F, E), systematically go through the STRIDE categories and ask:
        
        - **S (Spoofing):** Can an attacker spoof the identity of this component or an entity interacting with it?
            
        - **T (Tampering):** Can an attacker tamper with data associated with this component (in flow or at rest)?
            
        - **R (Repudiation):** Can an action performed by or on this component be denied later without proof?
            
        - **I (Information Disclosure):** Can sensitive information be disclosed from or about this component?
            
        - **D (Denial of Service):** Can an attacker make this component unavailable to legitimate users?
            
        - **E (Elevation of Privilege):** Can an attacker gain unauthorized higher privileges over this component?
            
4. **Identify Vulnerabilities:**
    
    - For each identified threat, brainstorm specific vulnerabilities that could allow that threat to materialize.
        
    - _Example:_ If you identify a "Tampering" threat on a "Data Flow" (an API request), a potential vulnerability could be "missing CSRF token" or "lack of input validation."
        
5. **Determine Mitigations:**
    
    - For each identified vulnerability, propose concrete security controls or design changes to address it.
        
    - _Example:_ For "missing CSRF token," the mitigation is "implement CSRF tokens." For "lack of input validation," the mitigation is "implement server-side input validation."
        
6. **Prioritize and Document:**
    
    - Assess the likelihood and impact of each identified risk to prioritize mitigation efforts. Not all threats are equal.
        
    - Document your findings, proposed mitigations, and assign ownership for remediation.
        

## Why is STRIDE Threat Modeling Useful?

- **Proactive Security:** Catches design flaws early, reducing the cost and effort of fixing them later.
    
- **Comprehensive Coverage:** Ensures you consider a wide range of potential attacks, not just the ones you're familiar with.
    
- **Structured Approach:** Provides a repeatable and systematic way to analyze security, making it easier to train teams and ensure consistency.
    
- **Common Language:** STRIDE provides a shared vocabulary for developers, architects, and security professionals to discuss security risks clearly.
    
- **Risk-Based Decisions:** Helps prioritize security investments by focusing on the most critical threats.
    
- **Compliance:** Can contribute to meeting security compliance requirements by demonstrating a structured approach to risk assessment.
    

By integrating STRIDE into your development process, you build security into the very foundation of your applications, rather than trying to patch it on later.
