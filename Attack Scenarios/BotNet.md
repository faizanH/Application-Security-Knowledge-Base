## 📌 Scenario/Question:

"I am your customer. I have a `/24` subnet of hosts on the Internet that I'd like you to pentest. Take me through, in detail, all the steps that you will go through in this assessment."

## 🎯 Core Vulnerabilities & Attack Vectors:

- **Primary Vulnerability:** This scenario focuses on the _discovery and exploitation of any exploitable vulnerability_ found on externally exposed hosts. There isn't one primary vulnerability, but rather a methodology to find various ones. However, the most common initial access vulnerabilities in such a scope are: **Security Misconfiguration (A05:2021)**, **Vulnerable and Outdated Components (A06:2021)**, and **Broken Authentication (A07:2021)**.
    
- **Secondary Vulnerabilities (if applicable):**
    
    - Network-level vulnerabilities: Open ports, weak firewall rules, insecure protocols (e.g., Telnet, FTP), insecure VPN configurations.
        
    - System-level vulnerabilities: Default credentials, unpatched OS/services, weak file permissions, exposed administrative interfaces.
        
    - Web application vulnerabilities (if web services are found): SQL Injection, XSS, Broken Access Control, File Upload Vulnerabilities, SSRF, Insecure Deserialization, Command Injection.
        
    - Cloud-specific misconfigurations (if cloud hosts): Overly permissive IAM policies, public S3 buckets, exposed cloud metadata services.
        
- **Relevant Attack Vectors/Concepts:** Reconnaissance, network scanning, service enumeration, vulnerability analysis, exploitation, privilege escalation, lateral movement, data exfiltration, persistence.
    

## 😈 Attacker's Perspective: Performing & Escalating the Attack

### 1. Initial Reconnaissance & Discovery within this Scenario:

My approach would follow a structured penetration testing methodology, typically encompassing Planning, Reconnaissance, Scanning, Enumeration, Vulnerability Analysis, Exploitation, Post-Exploitation, and Reporting.

- **Initial access point / Entry vector:** The `/24` subnet provided by the customer, which implies direct internet exposure.
    
- **Information to gather:**
    
    - **Passive Reconnaissance (OSINT):**
        
        - **Domain Information:** Associated domains, subdomains, DNS records (A, MX, NS, TXT records for SPF/DMARC).
            
        - **Publicly Available Information:** Employee names, email addresses (LinkedIn, company website), public code repositories (GitHub), social media.
            
        - **Historical Data:** WayBack Machine for old website versions, Shodan/Censys for historical port scans and banners.
            
        - **Associated IP Ranges:** Identify other IP ranges owned by the organization.
            
    - **Active Reconnaissance / Scanning:**
        
        - **Host Discovery:** Identify all live hosts within the `/24` subnet.
            
        - **Port Scanning:** Discover all open ports on identified live hosts (TCP and UDP).
            
        - **Service Enumeration:** Identify the services running on open ports (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, SSH, FTP, SMTP, DNS, RDP, SMB, database services), including their exact versions and underlying operating systems.
            
        - **Web Application Discovery:** Identify all web applications, virtual hosts, and their technologies (e.g., Apache, Nginx, IIS, Tomcat, specific frameworks like WordPress, Jira, custom apps).
            
- **General tools for recon/discovery:**
    
    - **Passive:** `whois`, `dig`, `nslookup`, Google Dorking, Shodan.io, Censys.io, OSINT frameworks (e.g., Maltego, SpiderFoot).
        
    - **Active:** `nmap` (for host discovery, port scanning, service version detection, OS fingerprinting, and running NSE scripts), `masscan` (for fast port scanning), `RustScan` (fast port scanner).
        

### 2. Attack Execution (How to Perform in this Scenario):

This phase involves detailed vulnerability analysis and exploitation based on the information gathered.

- **Vulnerability Analysis & Exploitation (Iterative Process):**
    
    - **Step 1: Prioritize Targets & Services.** Based on reconnaissance, prioritize internet-facing services known for vulnerabilities (e.g., web servers, remote access services like RDP/SSH, database ports).
        
    - **Step 2: Web Application Vulnerability Assessment.**
        
        - For each identified web application, perform a comprehensive web application penetration test.
            
        - **Initial Scan:** Use automated web vulnerability scanners (e.g., Burp Suite Pro, OWASP ZAP) for common issues (SQLi, XSS, SSRF, misconfigurations).
            
        - **Manual Testing:** Focus on OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities:
            
            - **SQL Injection (SQLi):** Test all input fields, parameters for SQLi.
                
            - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Test all input/output points for reflected, stored, and DOM XSS.
                
            - **Broken Access Control (BAC) / IDOR:** Test authorization logic for horizontal and vertical privilege escalation.
                
            - **File Upload Vulnerabilities:** Test file upload forms for unrestricted file upload, web shell upload.
                
            - **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** Test endpoints that fetch URLs for internal network access or cloud metadata.
                
            - **Command Injection:** Test inputs passed to system commands.
                
            - **Insecure Deserialization:** Look for endpoints handling serialized data.
                
            - **Authentication/Session Management:** Test for weak password policies, brute-force, session fixation, insecure session IDs.
                
            - **Security Misconfigurations:** Check for verbose error messages, directory listings, default credentials, exposed admin panels.
                
            - **Vulnerable & Outdated Components:** Identify known CVEs in frameworks, libraries, web servers, etc.
                
    - **Step 3: Network Service Vulnerability Assessment.**
        
        - For each identified open port and service:
            
            - **Banner Grabbing:** Confirm service and version information.
                
            - **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use network vulnerability scanners (e.g., Nessus, OpenVAS, Qualys, Nexpose) to identify known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in specific service versions.
                
            - **Manual Exploitation:** Attempt to exploit identified vulnerabilities using public exploits (e.g., from Exploit-DB, Metasploit) or custom-crafted payloads. This could involve:
                
                - Exploiting unpatched SSH/RDP services.
                    
                - Exploiting vulnerabilities in database services (e.g., SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL).
                    
                - Exploiting vulnerabilities in mail servers (SMTP, POP3, IMAP).
                    
                - Attempting brute-force attacks against exposed login services (SSH, RDP, web logins).
                    
                - Testing for anonymous access to FTP/SMB shares.
                    
    - **Step 4: Credential Attacks.**
        
        - If any credentials (usernames, password hashes) are found during web app or service exploitation, attempt to crack them (`John the Ripper`, `Hashcat`).
            
        - Perform credential stuffing or brute-force attacks against identified login portals.
            

### 3. Escalation & Impact:

If initial access is gained, the focus shifts to increasing control and demonstrating impact.

- **Privilege Escalation:**
    
    - **Local Privilege Escalation:** If a low-privilege shell is obtained on a host (e.g., via web shell, vulnerable service), attempt to gain root/administrator privileges on that system. This involves:
        
        - Checking for kernel exploits.
            
        - Looking for misconfigured SUID/SGID binaries (Linux) or insecure file/registry permissions (Windows).
            
        - Searching for vulnerable services running as high-privileged users.
            
        - Exploiting weak cron jobs (Linux) or scheduled tasks (Windows).
            
        - Using tools like LinPEAS/WinPEAS.
            
    - **Application-level Privilege Escalation:** If a web application user is compromised, attempt to elevate to an admin role within the application.
        
- **Lateral Movement:**
    
    - Once a host is compromised, use it as a pivot point to scan and access other internal hosts within the customer's network (if any internal network access is available from the compromised host).
        
    - Look for internal network segments, other applications, or data stores that are now accessible.
        
    - Search for internal credentials, SSH keys, API keys, or configuration files on the compromised host that could grant access to other systems.
        
    - Attempt to access databases, file shares, or other services that were not internet-facing but are now accessible.
        
- **Data Exfiltration:**
    
    - Identify sensitive data on compromised systems (e.g., customer databases, employee PII, intellectual property, financial records, source code).
        
    - Demonstrate the ability to exfiltrate this data to an attacker-controlled server.
        
- **Business Impact:**
    
    - **Data Breach:** Exposure of sensitive customer, employee, or proprietary data (leading to reputational damage, regulatory fines, legal action).
        
    - **Financial Loss:** Direct financial loss from fraudulent transactions, ransomware, or intellectual property theft.
        
    - **Operational Disruption:** Denial of Service (DoS) by crashing critical services, or system unavailability due to ransomware.
        
    - **Reputational Damage:** Due to public disclosure of a breach or defacement.
        
    - **Compliance Violations:** Failure to meet regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS).
        
    - **Supply Chain Impact:** If the compromised system is part of a larger supply chain.
        

## 🛡️ Defender's Perspective: Mitigations, Trade-offs, & Secure Design

### 1. Specific Mitigations Applied to this Scenario:

- **Prevention at Input/Processing (for web apps):**
    
    - Implement robust input validation and output encoding for all user-supplied data to prevent web application vulnerabilities (SQLi, XSS, Command Injection, SSRF).
        
    - Strictly whitelist file types and content for file uploads.
        
- **Prevention at Output/Display (for web apps):**
    
    - Context-aware output encoding for all user-generated content.
        
    - Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP).
        
- **Authentication/Authorization Controls:**
    
    - **Strong Authentication:** Enforce strong, unique passwords, MFA for all external-facing services. Implement rate limiting on login attempts.
        
    - **Robust Authorization:** Implement server-side authorization checks for all object references and actions (BAC/IDOR).
        
    - **Secure Session Management:** Use HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite flags for cookies, strong session IDs, and proper session invalidation.
        
- **Configuration & Environment Hardening:**
    
    - **Network Segmentation:** Implement strict network segmentation (VPCs, subnets, VLANs) and firewall rules (Security Groups, Network ACLs, host-based firewalls) to enforce least privilege network access. Only expose absolutely necessary ports to the internet.
        
    - **Remove Default Credentials:** Change all default passwords and disable default accounts.
        
    - **Disable Unnecessary Services/Features:** Turn off all services and features not actively required on internet-facing hosts.
        
    - **Secure Error Handling:** Configure applications and web servers to provide generic error messages in production, logging detailed errors internally.
        
    - **Regular Patch Management:** Implement a rigorous, automated patch management process for all operating systems, applications, frameworks, and libraries.
        
    - **Secure Configuration Baselines:** Apply industry-standard hardening guides (e.g., CIS Benchmarks) to all servers and services.
        
    - **Secrets Management:** Store all sensitive credentials (API keys, database passwords) in dedicated secrets management solutions, not in plaintext files or hardcoded.
        
    - **Disable Directory Listing:** Ensure web servers do not allow directory browsing.
        
- **Monitoring & Incident Response:**
    
    - **Comprehensive Logging:** Enable verbose logging across all layers (network devices, OS, web servers, applications, databases). Aggregate logs to a centralized SIEM.
        
    - **Real-time Alerts:** Set up alerts for:
        
        - Unusual login attempts (brute-force, invalid credentials).
            
        - Suspicious network traffic (e.g., high volume to unusual ports, outbound connections to known bad IPs).
            
        - Vulnerability scanner activity.
            
        - Application errors indicating injection attempts.
            
        - File integrity monitoring alerts.
            
    - **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):** Deploy IDS/IPS at network perimeter and potentially internally to detect and block malicious traffic patterns.
        
    - **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a WAF in front of all web applications to filter malicious HTTP/S traffic.
        
    - **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):** Deploy EDR solutions on hosts for advanced threat detection and response.
        
    - **Incident Response Plan:** Develop and regularly test a detailed incident response plan for detecting, containing, eradicating, and recovering from security incidents.
        
- **Other relevant controls for this scenario:**
    
    - **DDoS Protection:** Implement DDoS mitigation services.
        
    - **Regular Vulnerability Scanning:** Conduct internal and external vulnerability scans regularly.
        

### 2. Trade-offs and Compromises:

- **Mitigation 1 (Strict Network Segmentation & Least Privilege):**
    
    - **Trade-off:** Increases network design complexity and initial setup time. Can lead to "access denied" issues during development/deployment if not meticulously managed. Requires ongoing maintenance of firewall rules.
        
- **Mitigation 2 (Comprehensive Logging & Alerting):**
    
    - **Trade-off:** High operational cost for log storage, processing, and SIEM licenses. Can lead to "alert fatigue" if not properly tuned, requiring dedicated security operations personnel.
        
- **Mitigation 3 (Regular Patching & Updates):**
    
    - **Trade-off:** Requires dedicated resources and a robust testing pipeline to ensure updates don't break existing functionality. Can introduce downtime if not managed carefully.
        
- **Overall discussion:** For internet-facing systems, security must be prioritized heavily. While these mitigations add complexity, cost, and operational overhead, the potential financial, reputational, and legal costs of a breach far outweigh them. Balancing these factors requires a risk-based approach, prioritizing the most critical assets and highest-impact vulnerabilities. Automation (IaC, automated patching, automated security testing) is key to managing these trade-offs efficiently.
    

### 3. Designing for Security (Proactive Measures for this Scenario):

- **Threat Modeling:** Conduct comprehensive threat modeling for all internet-facing systems and applications from the design phase. Use frameworks like STRIDE to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities.
    
- **Secure by Design/Default Principles:**
    
    - **"Deny by Default":** For network access, application permissions, and user authorization.
        
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Apply to all users, service accounts, IAM roles, and network access.
        
    - **Attack Surface Reduction:** Design systems to minimize exposed ports, services, and unnecessary features.
        
    - **Secure Defaults:** Ensure all deployed components (OS, web servers, databases, frameworks) are configured securely from the start, overriding insecure defaults.
        
- **Secure Coding Guidelines/Frameworks:**
    
    - Enforce secure coding standards for all application development (e.g., OWASP Cheat Sheets).
        
    - Use secure frameworks and libraries that handle common vulnerabilities (e.g., parameterized queries, auto-escaping).
        
- **Security Testing in SDLC:**
    
    - **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security Scanning:** Integrate tools (e.g., Checkov, Terrascan) to scan cloud configurations and infrastructure code for misconfigurations before deployment.
        
    - **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Use tools (Snyk, Dependabot) to identify vulnerable third-party components in code.
        
    - **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** Integrate SAST into CI/CD pipelines for code analysis.
        
    - **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Run DAST scans against deployed applications in staging environments.
        
    - **Regular Penetration Testing:** Conduct recurring, independent penetration tests (like this scenario) to identify vulnerabilities that automated tools might miss.
        
    - **Red Teaming:** For mature organizations, conduct red team exercises to test the overall security posture and incident response capabilities.
        
- **Security Training & Awareness:**
    
    - Provide continuous security training for developers, operations teams, and IT staff on secure coding, secure configuration, and common attack vectors.
        
    - Promote a security-first culture across the organization.
